-------DataBase-------

	1.Cloud Storage is for files 
	2.DataBase are for Structured Data

Cloud SQL	 (SQL)						(RDS)
Cloud Spanner(SQL)					(Aurora conceptually)
Fire Storage (NOSQL)				(DynamoDB conceptually)
Big Table	 (NOSQL)				(DynamoDB conceptually)
Big Query	 (Analytics DB)				(Redshift)

										
First Understand the Problem

Before Cloud SQL, if a company wanted a database, they had to:
1.Install MySQL/PostgreSQL on a VM
2.Configure storage
3.Set up backups
4.Configure replication
5.Handle crashes
6.Do patching & upgrades
7.Manage high availability
This requires a DBA(Database Administor) || This is risky and complex

					-------CLOUD SQL----------(Structured transcational data and small databases || The data is less than GB only)

Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It is used for structured data that requires SQL queries, relationships, and transactions such as users, orders, and business records.	

Google Manage : Installation, Patching, Backups ,High availability ,Replication, Failover										

-->You only focus on using the database.

EXAMPLE :1 E-Commerce App

-->Let's build a shopping wesite
We need to store:
Users
Products
Orders
Payments
These tables are related.

Example:
User places an order
Order must link to:
User table
Product table

This relationship is very important.
This is why we use a relational database.

			ARCHITECTURE:
					Users → Load Balancer → App Server (VM / GKE)
                               |
                           Cloud SQL

                     -->App server handles logic.
					 -->Cloud SQL stores structured data.

-->When we use Cloud SQL
We use it when:
We need SQL queries
Medium-scale applications
Traditional relational data

-->We do NOT use Cloud SQL:
Global scale with millions of transactions per second
Massive distributed systems
 
REGION : SINGLE REGION

 								------------CLOUD SPANNER----------

Cloud Spanner is a globally distributed, horizontally scalable relational database that provides strong consistency and high availability across multiple regions.

CLOUD SQL is only for Medium applications, Regional workloads, Thousands of users, only one REGION , Scaling is limited 

Now imagine : 
You are having
10 million users
Users from US, India, Europe
System must never go down
Data must be consistent globally but Cloud SQL struggles here.

Cloud Spanner is:

👉 A globally distributed relational database
👉 Supports SQL
👉 Horizontally scalable
👉 Strongly consistent

Simple meaning:
Spanner = SQL database + Global scale + Automatic sharding

EXAMPLE 1 : Global Airline Booking System

Let's take a Indigo Company

Users are are booking tickets from 

-->India 
-->USA
-->UAE
-->AUSTRALIA

❌ What Can Go Wrong with Normal Database?

If database is only in US:
Indian users experience high latency
If US region fails --> system down
Risk of double seat booking
This is dangerous.

✅ Solution: Cloud Spanner

		Architecture:

						Users (India)  --> Closest Spanner Node
						Users (USA)     --> Closest Spanner Node
						Users (UAE) --> Closest Spanner Node
						All nodes share same consistent databases

✔ Data is globally distributed ,super-scalable SQL database.
✔ Strong consistency
✔ If one region fails --> system continues
✔ No double booking

CLOUD SPANNER IS SPECIAL BECAUSE :
-->Horizontal Scaling : You can add more nodes → more capacity (No downtime)
-->Global Multi-Region Setup : Data replicated across continents.
-->Strong Consistency : If one user books a seat and other users instantly see updated availability.

						------------FILE STORE-----------

Firestore is a scalable NoSQL document database used for flexible, real-time applications such as chat apps, mobile apps, and social platforms.

👉 Automatically scalable
👉 Real-time synchronized (eg : Auto update in zomato while delivering the order)
👉 Stores data in JSON-like documents
		eg: 
			{
		 	  "name": "sunny",
			  "age": 25,
			  "isOnline": true
			}
	
No fixed colums like SQL

----EXAMPLE 1 : (CHAT APPLICATION)
	
	Imagine you are building a chat application
	You need to store users, chat rooms , messages, etc..
	Each message look like 
eg : 
{
  "sender": "user_1",
  "text": "Hello",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-13",
  "isRead": false
}

Messages keep increase every second 

❌ If You Use SQL

Problems:
Constant inserts
Need schema changes often
Real-time sync is hard
Scaling becomes complex	

✅ If You Use Firestore
		Architecture:
				Mobile App ↔ Firestore

When user sends message :
✔ Stored instantly
✔ Other user sees it in real-time
✔ Automatically scales
✔ No schema changes needed

EXAMPLE : 2  Social Media App

User profile :
{
  "name": "Priya",
  "followers": 1000,
  "bio": "Cloud Engineer"
}

Later user adds:
"instagram_link": "..."

In SQL --> need ALTER TABLE
In Firestore --> just add new field
Flexible.

Strong Use Case – Real-Time Tracking App


-->Use Firestore when:
✔ Data is flexible
✔ Schema changes often
✔ You need real-time updates
✔ Mobile-first application
✔ Massive concurrent users

-->Do NOT use Firestore when:
❌ You need complex joins
❌ Heavy relational queries
❌ Strict financial transactions
❌ Banking systems

In those cases → Cloud SQL or Spanner
													
If data is:
Structured + relationships + joins → Cloud SQL
Flexible + real-time + high user scale → Firestore														

						--------------BIG TABLE-------------
Cloud Bigtable is a high-performance, massively scalable NoSQL wide-column database used for time-series data, IoT workloads, and large-scale analytics logs.
	--A NoSQL wide-column database
	--Designed for petabytes of data
	--Extremely fast for large workloads
	--Used internally by Google

1-->First Understand Why Bigtable Exists

We already have:
Cloud SQL → Structured business data
Firestore → Flexible mobile/chat data

So when do we need Bigtable?
👉 When data becomes extremely huge
👉 When we need very fast reads/writes
👉 When structure is simple
👉 When traffic is massive
Bigtable is built for massive scale + high throughput.

It stores data like:

		Row Key -> Column Families -> Columns

It is not like SQL tables.
It is optimized for scale and speed.


USECASE 1: Analytics Logs
Large Website (Amazon-Level)

Website has:
Millions of users
Click tracking
Page views
Search history

Every user action is logged.
This generates huge data.

BigTable Stores 
UserID + Timestamp → Activity Data
Very fast reads and writes.


EXAMPLE 1 : Gaming Platform

Game with:
Millions of players
Leaderboards
Match history
Player stats

Bigtable stores:
PlayerID --> Stats
Fast lookup
High concurrency

Use Bigtable when:

✔ Data is extremely large (TB–PB scale)
✔ High write throughput
✔ Time-series data
✔ IoT workloads
✔ Analytics logs
✔ Low-latency key-based lookups



Do NOT use Bigtable when:

❌ You need joins
❌ Complex SQL queries
❌ Financial transactions
❌ Small applications

Then use:
Cloud SQL
Spanner
Firestore

											----------BIGQUERY------------
BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse used for large-scale analytics, reporting, and business intelligence, not for transactional workloads. It is a serverless and Handles TBs or PBs of data , It can scan billions of rows in seconds.

First Understand the Core Idea
BigQuery is:

👉 A Data Warehouse
👉 Used for analytics
👉 Not used for running applications
👉 Not used for transactions

Very important:
BigQuery is for analysis, not for day-to-day app operations.


-->Why Normal Databases Are Not Good for Analytics
Imagine you have:
Cloud SQL storing orders
App running normally
Thousands of transactions per second

		Now business team says:
		“Give me sales report for last 3 years.”
		“Which city buys more?”
		“Which product performs best during festivals?”

If you run huge queries on Cloud SQL:
App becomes slow
Database performance drops
Users get delays
Because Cloud SQL is optimized for:
✔ Transactions
❌ Heavy analytics

EXAMPLE 1 : E-Commerce Company
Company has:
10 million users
5 years of order history
Billions of records
Daily transactions go to:
👉 Cloud SQL (operational database)

Every night:
Data is exported to:
👉 BigQuery (analytics warehouse)

			ARCHITECTURE :
					Users → App → Cloud SQL (Transactions)
					Cloud SQL → ETL / Dataflow → BigQuery (Analytics)

-->Now Business Team Runs Queries Like:
Total sales last 5 years
Top 10 products by region
Monthly growth percentage
Customer retention analysis
BigQuery handles this easily.

App is not affected.


------Key Characteristics
👉Columnar storage (optimized for analytics)
👉Handles petabyte-scale data
👉Serverless (no VM management)
👉Pay per query
👉Extremely fast for aggregation queries


Use BigQuery when:
✔ You need reports
✔ Business intelligence
✔ Large-scale analytics
✔ Historical data analysis
✔ Dashboarding
✔ Data science workloads



Do NOT use BigQuery for:
❌ Running your application backend
❌ Storing live user sessions
❌ High-frequency transactions
❌ Banking transactions
